Email signatures are a great way of adding some advertising and branding. You should always use a nice email signature for **external emails** .
Internally, you shouldn't use any or just use a short one (just your name or initials).

Full email signatures are great when they have:

* A little  **branding** and advertising (can be a tagline or company news), so people know instantly who it is from
* Your  **phone number** (in international format - it's important to add the country code so people from all around the world can easily add you to their contacts - as per [Do you know the right format to show phone numbers?](/do-you-know-the-right-format-to-show-your-phone-number))
* Your company  **website link** (e.g. www.ssw.com.au/)
* Your work-related  **social media** and  **blog** link
* Your **position**
* Your  **location** (city/country) where you are based

Mobile signature are not easily customized so they can be simpler.

### PC Long Signature

**Use the complete "long signature" when sending a new email or appointment to a client.**

This is created in HTML and goes well on emails with Word used as the email editor. Include some product advertising, like what's new on your monthly newsletter. It should have the company colors.

However, you shouldn't use your long signature on **every** sent email. It's recommended to have a simpler version for internal emails and appointments:

### PC Short Signature

Use a really short signature (your first name or initials) or no signature at all in internal emails  as people already know who you are.

**Note:** You can see Ulysses using this rule in practice, along with other best practices, on this short [demonstration video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAqRokqq4jI)

### Option 1: CodeTwo (Paid)


To be as consistent as possible, going with a third-party signature provider (e.g. CodeTwo, Exclaimer) is the easiest way to have great email signatures, as consistent as possible, to all your employees and all devices, at any time. At SSW we use CodeTwo as our signature provider and the benefits are many:

1. Consistent signature for every employee – we value consistency at SSW
2. Central management location for all signatures
3. Marketing campaign schedule for all signatures
4. Automatic signature adding on any device – from laptop to smartphones
5. Hassle-free setup – Managed centrally, users won’t need to touch any signatures CodeTwo also has 2 plugins for you to use: one for previewing the signatures that will be applied, and one for choosing the signatures manually, yourself.

### Option 2: Set it up manually (Free)

**How to set it up in Outlook**
